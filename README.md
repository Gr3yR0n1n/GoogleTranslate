This is a menu bar application wrapping a simplified version of Google Translate webpage in a `webview` for quick access to the translation service.

Use `CMD+G` to show/hide it quickly and `CMD+SHIFT+S` to swap active languages.

There are two options to toggle, which can be accessed by right clicking on the tray icon

- __Remember language:__ When enabled this option saves your last selected languages.
- __Clear on blur:__ When enabled this option clears the input field when the application window is hidden.
